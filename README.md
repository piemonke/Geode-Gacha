# Geode-Gacha
This project is the groundworks for an inventory management system used for games, with a pull system based on Gacha games.

It makes use of cracking open geodes, rocks with crystalline formations inside them, as the basis for it's inventory, however it could be modified to use different models for different games.
A working deployed version of what this looks like can be found here: https://geode-gacha.herokuapp.com/
